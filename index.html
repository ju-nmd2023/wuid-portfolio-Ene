            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My Name is Ene, I'm 18 years old studying Graphic Design and Web Development at Jonköping University. 
            I come from Kosovo, but I've lived in Hungary and Croatia as well seeing as my mom is the first female
            ambassador of Kosovo. Im an Aries, I can play the piano and guitar, and I finished the IB. The IB was one of the hardest things I've done, but it taught me how to write reports in a day since I procrastinated a lot. </p>
            <p>
                I've always liked visual art. Art was my favorite class in 9th grade, and also the one I excelled in. Other than the arts, I liveeee for psychology. It was my favorite high school subject, and also the one I scored highest on. Who knew it would come in handy in this programme. When Bruce talked about dual-processing theory, who yassed? Me, I yassed. Giving and serving is what I do. In fact, some of my serves are right below this paragraph.

            <h2>My Favorite Media</h2>
            <p>One thing about me is that I love consuming media. Yum yum, delish dopamine for my receptors. My favorite singers at the moment would have to be Marina Diamandis, Monika Liu, Metronomy, and 
                lowkey am having a Beyoncé resurgence at the moment. There really is a reason she's so respected and stanned. For more insights into my 
                music taste, you can always click my spotify link in the header. 
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to movies and TV shows, that's pretty simple. My favorite movie of all time has to be Ocean's 8.
                I can quote it start-to-finish and watch it over and over without ever getting bored. In this vein, I have to
                mention The Devil Wears Prada as well, classic comfort movie I live for. Finally, Coraline must have her moment
                as well. I would say underrated but I really do think its appropriately rated, everyone loves that movie. As far 
                as TV shows go, I have 3 main ones that I adore; Russian Doll, The Good Place, and Pushing Daisies. All gorg, all 
                flawless.
