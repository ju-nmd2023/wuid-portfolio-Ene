    <img class="dua" src="img/duacover.JPG" alt="Alternate Cover for Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia album">
    <p class="dua">This album cover was one of my first ventures into Graphic Design. When Dua Lipa had released her Deluxe edition for the Future Nostalgia album, I was unhappy with how it had turned out, thinking that it did not reflect the vibe of the album. So, I made my own to upload to my music streaming app. I felt as though the iridescent skirt mimmiced a disco ball, mirroring the album's genre</p>
